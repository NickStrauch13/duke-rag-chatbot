Academic Preparation
While some of our students come directly from undergraduate programs which focus heavily on programming and/or math, many students come from other branches of engineering, science or medicine, or join our program after a few years of industry experience.  Spending some time before the Fall semester start brushing up on your programming (Python preferable) and math skills will help make the learning curve a bit easier once classes start.  If you are not comfortable with Python programming and math (calculus, probability and statistics, basic linear algebra), we highly recommend pursuing some independent study before the Bootcamp begins in July.  To assist you we have compiled the following recommended resources, all of which are free or low-cost and available online.

Programming:
Python for Everybody Specialization, University of Michigan – Coursera.  Introductory-level set of courses on programming in Python.  Free to audit each course
Math
Data Science Math Skills, Duke University – Coursera.  Covers the basics of calculus and probability/statistics.  Free to audit
Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra. Stanford University.  View the lectures free via YouTube (click on “lecture videos”) and/or read the first half of the book – free to download the pdf version. Provides a gentle introduction to key concepts from linear algebra which are needed for data science.
===
How do I register for classes?
All students register for classes through DukeHub, the self-service application that provides students with an array of information and direct access to academic, financial, and personal data. Access to DukeHub is gained using your NetID and password.
===
What classes outside of the AIPI curriculum can I count toward my technical electives requirement?
Approved AIPI electives are listed on the AIPI website.  Additionally, students may take technical electives in other programs and departments across campus with approval from both the course instructor and the AIPI Director. Please note that graduate courses outside of AIPI require an instructor’s permission to enroll, and it is ultimately at the instructor’s discretion to determine whether or not AIPI students will be allowed into a particular class.
===
Can I audit classes? 
Yes, AIPI students may audit courses on a space-available basis with consent of the instructor and the AIPI Director. Audited courses appear on your transcript and you will receive a grade of AD (indicating successful completion) that will not count toward your GPA. Audited courses do not count toward the fulfillment of AIPI degree requirements.
===
How many classes can I audit per semester?
AIPI students may audit up to two courses per semester. 
===
How many classes should I register for? 
In order for international students to remain in compliance with their F-1 visas, they must be registered as a full-time student. For visa purposes, full-time enrollment is considered 9.0 credits per semester (equivalent to three 3.0-credit courses). However, a typical full-time load for AIPI Campus students is 12.0 credits per semester (four 3.0-credit courses). Therefore, full-time residential graduate students pay tuition on a flat-rate, per-semester billing basis and are charged the equivalent of 12.0 credits per semester. Most full-time students enroll in at least 12.0 credits per semester.  AIPI Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570).  AIPI Online students typically take 2 courses per semester (Fall: AIPI 510,520) and AIPI Certificate students take 1 course/semester (Fall: AIPI 510).  Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a flat-rate per-semester basis.
===
What is the limit on credits I can take each semester?
AIPI students may take up to 15.0 credits per semester. Full-time residential students on the pay-by-semester basis may take a fifth credit for free each semester (although we generally suggest a maximum of 4 courses as the workload can be intense). Students who attempt to enroll in more than 15.0 credits per semester will not be able to register.
===
What is Drop/Add? What happens during the Drop/Add period?
The Drop/Add period occurs after the initial Registration window and continues until the end of the second week of classes. During the Drop/Add period, students may make changes to their schedules through DukeHub. At the end of the Drop/Add period, students’ schedules may no longer be changed in DukeHub and can only be changed with permission from their dean.
===
For Campus students, is there a formal process for selecting between the 12-month and 16-month plan?
No, there is no specific documentation that must be provided if you choose to extend the AIPI Program to three semesters. However, the earlier you make the decision the better as it will likely affect your selection of courses in Fall and Spring semesters.
===
How long do classes meet? How frequently do classes meet? 
Each course typically meets once per week for 2 hours and 45 minutes. 
===
How much time is required outside of class for AIPI courses?
AIPI classes are challenging and require significant work outside of class. Each week, you should expect to spend between 8-10 hours per course working outside of class.
===
Is there a formal process for designating my elective track? 
No, there is not currently a formal process to designate your elective track. We do not require students to rigidly adhere to one elective track. Students may choose electives that fit their professional goals. The elective tracks are meant as guides for students to align and develop skills toward a particular area, and those students who complete a track may list it on their resume.
===
What do I do if I want to change my elective track?
If you wish to change your elective track, there is no formal action that you need to take. However, it is a good idea to speak with the program director about your elective course plans, as they can help steer you toward courses that align with your professional aspirations.
===
How much does it cost to audit a course? 
For AIPI students who pay tuition on a pay-by-semester basis (as is the case for all full-time residential AIPI students), there is no charge for auditing a course. For AIPI Online students who pay tuition on a pay-by-credit basis, there is a charge of $535 per audited course.
===
How are tuition and fees assessed for AIPI students?
Full-time students in the AIPI Campus Program are automatically set up on a pay-per-semester billing system, meaning they will be charged the equivalent of four separate courses. Students enrolling as AIPI Online and Certificate students will automatically be set up for payments on a per-credit basis. 
===
Is financial aid available to AIPI students? 
Because the AIPI degree is a professional degree rather than a research degree, most students pay their own tuition costs.
===
How do I get a Teaching Assistant (TA) position?
Teaching assistantships are a common way that AIPI students can work on campus, earn money, and give of their time to the AIPI community. Most often, course instructors approach students who have done well in their course and ask them to TA in a subsequent semester. Other times, students will voice their interest to the instructor to initiate the conversation about a TA position. Toward the beginning of each semester, there are usually a few TA positions to be filled, and an announcement about open positions will be emailed out to students. TA positions are not often available for incoming students, as these positions are typically filled by continuing students who have taken the course before.

In order to be on Duke’s payroll, all students must have a Social Security Number on file. If a student intends to work on campus and be paid as an employee of the University, then that student should plan to apply for a Social Security Number. More information about applying for a Social Security Number may be found here.
===
What other employment positions are available for students on campus? 
In addition to Teaching Assistantships, AIPI students can work in a variety of roles around campus, such as the campus libraries and various departments within Duke. Some departments have research assistantships as well. These positions are paid at an hourly rate, and some positions are posted and filled just a week or two before classes begin each semester. DukeList is the best place to look for these opportunities, but other opportunities may be advertised via email or word-of-mouth. 
===
Where can I find information about student employment?
DukeList is the best place to look for these opportunities, but other opportunities may be advertised via email or word-of-mouth. Please see DukeList for more information: https://dukelist.duke.edu/
===
I’m an international student. Can I work off-campus?
International students on F-1 visas are not permitted to work off-campus except as part of their Curricular Practical Training (CPT). Students who are F-1 visaholders may work in on-campus positions, such as teaching assistantships, but must have a Social Security Number to be on Duke payroll.
===
How do I get my NetID and password?
You should receive a separate email from the Office of Information Technology (OIT) with instructions to set up your NetID and email alias. Your NetID is your electronic key to online resources, including your Duke email account, DukeHub, Sakai, MyDuke, Box cloud storage, and more. Please set up your NetID as soon as possible.
===
When will I get access to my Duke email?
Once you set up your NetID (see above), you will be able to access your email. This site provides information about how to access your Duke email account. Once you have access to your Duke email, please begin checking and using this address. Your Duke email address will become the primary source for all your communications from Duke.
===
What can I do this summer to prepare for the AIPI program?
While some of our students come directly from undergraduate programs which focus heavily on programming and/or math, many students come from other branches of engineering, science or medicine, or join our program after a few years of industry experience.  Spending some time before the Fall semester start brushing up on your programming (Python preferable) and math skills will help make the learning curve a bit easier once classes start.  If you are not comfortable with Python programming and math (calculus, probability and statistics, basic linear algebra), we highly recommend pursuing some independent study before the Bootcamp begins in late July.

===
MENG and MEM Supplemental Internship Courses
Two new supplemental internship courses have been approved and will be available beginning in Fall 2023. These courses are designed to provide an opportunity for students to perform a part-time internship (19.9 hours limit) during the fall or spring semester once a student has completed their required program internship. We anticipate this being most valuable for international students who are asked to continue a summer internship into the fall semester, but applies to any part-time internships and so students could complete an internship for company A over the summer and do another part-time internship for company B in the Fall. Additionally, there is also an opportunity to have the fall internship continue over winter break for students that are not graduating. Note: since there are not separate classes over winter break, it is not possible to get CPT for only working over the winter term.

We are excited to be able to add these new classes because these were previously difficult for MENG and MEM international students. Through this course, international students will be able to use CPT for work authorization for additional internship experiences. MS students wanting additional internship experiences can continue to use their departmental internship courses (BME  789 – Internship in Biomedical Engineering, CEE  780 – Internship, ECE  891 – Internship, ME  758S – Curricular Practical Training).

 Here are a few details about these classes that you should keep in mind:

You must have completed your required internship first. (EGRMGMT 550 or MENG 550 is a prerequisite.)
The work should be part-time (< 19.9 hours per week) in the Fall and Spring terms and can be part-time or full-time in the summer/winter break.
International students are required to be a residential student in Durham for classes taken in the Fall and Spring semesters. Therefore, the work must be local or remote.
This is a 3 unit class and will count toward your 9 unit full-time status requirement.
This course is NOT tuition bearing. Students will not be charged tuition for this course
If this is your last semester of study, this course does not fulfill the 1 unit tuition bearing requirement for MENG or the 3 unit tuition bearing requirement for MEM students.
These units do NOT count toward the 30 units required for your MENG or MEM degree 
 You can take this class multiple times and so for, example, could take it in both in the Fall and Spring semesters of your second year.
Students will want to monitor their total CPT work experience. Students who use 12 months or more of full-time (20 or more hours per week) CPT will have no available time for Optional Practical Training (OPT).
Standard CPT rules apply https://visaservices.duke.edu/categories/f1/cpt in that international students need to have completed one academic year (2 semesters) of study in the US prior to be eligible for CPT.
If you want to take this course in the fall, please sign up for the section associated with your program. Also, there will be two different sections per program. One labeled “Graduating” and the other “Continuing.” Please note that if you are graduating in Fall 2023 and register for this class you must register for the “Graduating” section and your internship must end by the end of the semester.

If you need CPT, you will need to apply for CPT for the summer internship and fall internship separately, meaning you would need one offer letter to participate in the summer internship and a separate offer letter to participate in the fall internship (listing applicable employment dates and work hours). Additionally, if you are a continuing student and want to work over winter break, you may do so part-time and your offer letter must define the range of dates that you will be working, with the latest date being the day before the start of the Spring semester.

Please work with Cherie Creten (cherie.createn@duke.edu) and follow the same procedure as you did for a summer internships.

If you have questions, please contact Associate Dean of Master’s Programs, Brad Fox at: brad.fox@duke.edu

CPT and OPT
 
Please visit the Duke Visa Services website for official instructions regarding requirements for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) and Optional Practical Training (OPT).  You may also contact Duke Visa Services at 919-681-8472. Questions about CPT, OPT, visas, and your eligibility/authorization to work in the United States should be directed to the Duke Visa Services Office.

Below is some additional information that may be helpful as you prepare to apply for CPT or pre- or post-completion OPT.  This information is provided as general guidelines and does not imply that a visa, work authorization, or successful graduation are guaranteed under any circumstances.

Differences Between CPT and OPT

Curricular Practical Training (CPT) is any alternative work/study, internship, cooperative education, or other type of required internship or practicum that is offered by sponsoring employers through cooperative agreements with a school.  Students must apply for CPT and be authorized by the Designated School Official (DSO = Duke Visa Services’ International Student/Scholar Advisor) prior to participating in a CPT program that is an integral part of an established curriculum.

Optional Practical Training (OPT) is a work authorization benefit for which eligible F-1 students may apply.  It may be used prior to or after completion of studies.  OPT taken prior to completion of studies is commonly referred to as “pre-completion OPT.”  Taken after completion of studies is called “post-completion OPT.”

Curricular Practical Training (CPT)

Requirements for CPT

Students studying on an F-1 visa.
Students have completed at least one academic year of study with the program.
Students are interning in the US.
Student’s internship must be related to their degree.
Students must have the letter of employment in writing

Read the Duke Visa Services CPT website thoroughly. Duke Visa Services recommends submitting your completed application materials at least 2 – 4 weeks before you are scheduled to begin work. Applications will be processed within 10 business days after all materials are received.

First, enroll in the appropriate section of your program’s internship course during the term in which you will be working.

Next, complete the electronic CPT application. You will need to enter the name and email address of someone who can provide an academic department recommendation. Enter the name and email address of the Student Records Coordinator – Cherie Creten and cherie.creten@duke.edu. The Student Records Coordinator will receive an email from Duke Visa Services requesting that they submit the academic department recommendation for the student.

Send the Student Records Coordinator a copy of your job offer letter. Before they can submit the academic department recommendation, the Student Records Coordinator must verify the following information:

The student is enrolled in the related internship course during the term in which they will be working
The job applies to the program of study and is clearly related in the description
Start and end dates are in the future and appropriate
The number of hours the student will work per week
Once the offer letter is reviewed and approved, the Student Records Coordinator will submit the academic department recommendation. Offer letters may be submitted to the Student Records Coordinator at cherie.creten@duke.edu.

If you have questions regarding the CPT application process, you may email Krysta Byrd, a Duke Visa Services advisor that specializes in CPT,
